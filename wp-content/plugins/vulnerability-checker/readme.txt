== Description ==

Vulnerability Checker is a comprehensive WordPress plugin designed to help you identify outdated plugins and themes, check for known vulnerabilities, and detect potential malware on your WordPress site. It ensures that your site remains secure and up-to-date by comparing the current versions of installed plugins and themes against the latest versions available and scanning files for suspicious code.

Features:
- Lists outdated plugins and themes with current and latest version information.
- Checks for known vulnerabilities in plugins and themes using the WPScan API.
- Scans files for common malicious patterns to detect potential malware.
- Simple and intuitive admin interface.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `vulnerability-checker` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go to the 'Vulnerability Checker' menu in the WordPress admin sidebar to view outdated plugins and themes, check for known vulnerabilities, and scan for malicious files.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does the plugin determine if a plugin or theme is outdated? =

The plugin compares the current version of each installed plugin and theme with the latest version available from the WordPress.org Plugin and Theme Directory APIs.

= How does the plugin check for known vulnerabilities? =
